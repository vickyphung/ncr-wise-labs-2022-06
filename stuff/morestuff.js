Challenge: charCount

Difficulty: Basic

Prompt:

- Write a function named charCount that accepts a single string argument and returns an object that represents the count of each character in the string.

- The returned object should have keys that represent the character with its value set to the how many times the character appears in the string argument.

- Upper and lower case characters should be counted separately.

- Space characters should be counted too.

Examples:

charCount('hello') //=> { h: 1, e: 1, l: 2, o: 1 }
charCount('Today is fantastic!') //=> { T: 1, o: 1, d: 1, a: 3, y: 1, ' ': 2, i: 2, s: 2, f: 1, n: 1, t: 2, c: 1, '!': 1 }

// Solve the following with a Frequency Counter
// --- Directions
// Check to see if two provided strings are anagrams of eachother.
// One string is an anagram of another if it uses the same characters
// in the same quantity. Only consider characters, not spaces
// or punctuation.  Consider capital letters to be the same as lower case
// --- Examples
//   anagrams('rail safety', 'fairy tales') --> True
//   anagrams('RAIL! SAFETY!', 'fairy tales') --> True
//   anagrams('Hi there', 'Bye there') --> False
